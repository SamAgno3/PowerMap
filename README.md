Currently this can run a full TCP connect scan against a single IP. The list of features coming soon is below
1) Multiple IPs, IP ranges, port ranges, and multiple port.
2) UDP Scans
3) Null Scans
4) Fin Scans
5) X-Mas Scans
6) Packet fragmentation, firewall evasion techniques

<h2> Usage </h2>
Currently, the program prompts you for input and guides you through the process of the scan. Can be run with the following command.

```

As more features are added, the use process will become easier with a dedicated --help flag.
